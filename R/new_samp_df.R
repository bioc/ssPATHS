#' @description A data frame with columns:
#' \describe{
#'  \item{sample_id}{String. The name of the sample. Samples with "hyp"
#'  or "norm" in the sample id are cell lines that were exposed to
#'  hypoxic or normoxic conditions respectively. Samples with "ctrl" or
#'  "noHIF" were samples that were able to produce a HIF-mediated hypoxic
#'  response or not, respectively.}
#'  \item{ENSG00000074410}{Int. Gene expression value for this gene.}
